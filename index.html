      Today is a good day. I'm learning how to make a website. I'm happy.

      I'm sad, since I will say goodbye to some of my classmates soon. They will go to new classes whose teacher will only teach the subjects they choose. I think... that's a great thing I mean. They can learn their favourite good at subjects. I think we can meet each other anyway.

      I'm sleepy. My final exam is coming, but I'm not nervous. I don't care how mmany points I get. I just want to keep company with my classmates, my <em>friends</em>. I'm happy everyone when I see my classmates. I don't know why, when I see my classmates, I can't help smiling. A big smile, a smile in heart. It's like... well I can't describe it. Really strange but good feeling.

      It's not early now. I must go to bed, or I will be sleepy tomorrow on class.
