    <p>My First Website!!! That's really GREAT!!!</p>
    <p>But this is only a static website, you cannot interact with it :(.</p>
    <p>Today is a good day. I'm learning how to make a website. I'm happy.</p>
    <p>I'm sad, since I will say goodbye to some of my classmates soon. They will go to new classes whose teacher will only teach the subjects they choose. I think... that's a great thing I mean. They can learn their favourite good at subjects. I think we can meet each other anyway.</p>
    <p>I'm sleepy. My final exam is coming, but I'm not nervous. I don't care how mmany scores I get. I just want to keep company with my classmates, my <em>friends</em>. I'm happy everyone when I see my classmates. I don't know why, when I see my classmates, I can't help smiling. A big smile, a smile in heart. It's like... well I can't describe it. Really strange but good feeling.</p>
    <p>It's not early now. I must go to bed, or I will be sleepy tomorrow on class.</p>

    <p>Today is the last workday before the final exam. I took the archives all back and gave back to my classmates. They will save their archives by themselves. After the winter break, they will give the archives to school again. Maybe they will give me. I hope they will give me.</p>
    <p>I think these days I'm a little... tired? Sometimes I don't have interests in maths, physics, or even programming. It's like I don't want to do anything, just want to lie down and rest. Is this feeling normal?</p>
    
    <div class="learn1">
      <p>I have learnt how to use a flex box.</p>
      <p>It can align the elements in one line! Fun!</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>And I'm trying to make a fun thing. <a href="todo/index.html">Click to have a look</a></p>
    <p>Although I write it by following the tutorial, I still feel proud of it. Next time I will make sth by myself.</p>
    <p>Also, I made a simple clock! <a href="clock/index.html">Have a look!</a></p>
    <p>This clock is too easy lol.</p>
    <p>Well let's talk about today's life. You know I hardly ever do my homework due to less time. But this morning, I knew I had to write some homework or my teacher will ponish me. Thus, I do some of my chemistry homework, 6 of 16 pages. However, on chemistry class, our teacher found that I didn't finished the homework while I was sharing my homework to my deskmate whose homework was lost. The teacher asked angrily to us: "Who didn't do the homework?". That moment, I was panick, really panick. The teacher let me off when she saw the 6 of 16 homework. But my heart beat quickily. I have never had this feeling for a long time. I was scared... Even hours later, I can not still calm down...</p>
    <p>I hope I won't have such feelings anymore, it's miserable.</p>

    <p>I'm adding MathJax: <a href="formula/index.html">Some fancy formulas</a>.</p>
    <p>Yesterday I was happy, pure happy. I taught my mother to use duolingo to learn English. I was really happy. Just like a year ago I was playing with my friend in hometown. How long haven't I had this feeling?</p>
    <p>Speaking of my hometown, I have a lot of memories there. In the winter holiday when I was in Grade Seven, I went to my hometown. Luckily, I met some children playing on the road. They were younger than me. I don't know why but just asked them if I can play with them. From then on, I made many best friends. I still remember their names, though I haven't seen some of them for a long time. Every winter holiday, I go to my hometown for the new year, then I can meet them. We did a lot of fun things.</p>
    <p>I haven't seen then for one year. I miss them so much. But I will see them soon QwQ</p>
    <p>I made a <a href="calculator/index.html">Calculator</a>. It cannot use though.</p>

    <p>Today I go home early, because I want to get a good rest for the upcoming final exam.</p>
    <p>At school, I actually did not do a lot of things. The teacher let us to attend the USACO contest. I am a noob, so I only did the first question. I know it's the problem was not difficult, they were only the Bronze division. Maybe it's a wrong choice for me to attend OI.</p>
    <p>I found there were some students doing homework in our classroom. I wish they will get good grades in the exam.</p>
    <p>Well now I'm at home. I am confused because I don't want to do anything, even programming. Am I too tired?</p>
    <p>I want to learn Calculus. AwA</p>

    <p>Today, I tried to read the book <em>Calculus, Early Transcendentals, Ninth Edition, Metric Version</em>. Well, I like the book. It was bought by my father, who bought plenty of books for me. I used almost 3 hours to read the book this morning, but I only finished chapter 1.1. There are too many exercises, which I must spend may time on that.</p>
    <p>I hate to go to extra-curricular class. My father signed up a Chinese extra-curricular class for me. I really, really, really don't want to go there.</p>
    <p>I'm learning how to make <a href="weather/index.html">weather icons</a>.</p>
