    <p>My First Website!!! That's really GREAT!!!</p>
    <p>But this is only a static website, you cannot interact with it :(.</p>
    <p>Today is a good day. I'm learning how to make a website. I'm happy.</p>
    <p>I'm sad, since I will say goodbye to some of my classmates soon. They will go to new classes whose teacher will only teach the subjects they choose. I think... that's a great thing I mean. They can learn their favourite good at subjects. I think we can meet each other anyway.</p>
    <p>I'm sleepy. My final exam is coming, but I'm not nervous. I don't care how mmany scores I get. I just want to keep company with my classmates, my <em>friends</em>. I'm happy everyone when I see my classmates. I don't know why, when I see my classmates, I can't help smiling. A big smile, a smile in heart. It's like... well I can't describe it. Really strange but good feeling.</p>
    <p>It's not early now. I must go to bed, or I will be sleepy tomorrow on class.</p>

    <p>Today is the last workday before the final exam. I took the archives all back and gave back to my classmates. They will save their archives by themselves. After the winter break, they will give the archives to school again. Maybe they will give me. I hope they will give me.</p>
    <p>I think these days I'm a little... tired? Sometimes I don't have interests in maths, physics, or even programming. It's like I don't want to do anything, just want to lie down and rest. Is this feeling normal?</p>
    
    <div class="learn1">
      <p>I have learnt how to use a flex box.</p>
      <p>It can align the elements in one line! Fun!</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>And I'm trying to make a fun thing. <a href="todo/index.html">Click to have a look</a></p>
    <p>Although I write it by following the tutorial, I still feel proud of it. Next time I will make sth by myself.</p>
    <p>Also, I made a simple clock! <a href="clock/index.html">Have a look!</a></p>
    <p>This clock is too easy lol.</p>
    <p>Well let's talk about today's life. You know I hardly ever do my homework due to less time. But this morning, I knew I had to write some homework or my teacher will ponish me. Thus, I do some of my chemistry homework, 6 of 16 pages. However, on chemistry class, our teacher found that I didn't finished the homework while I was sharing my homework to my deskmate whose homework was lost. The teacher asked angrily to us: "Who didn't do the homework?". That moment, I was panick, really panick. The teacher let me off when she saw the 6 of 16 homework. But my heart beat quickily. I have never had this feeling for a long time. I was scared... Even hours later, I can not still calm down...</p>
    <p>I hope I won't have such feelings anymore, it's miserable.</p>

    <p>This is LikablePie79015 from Henan, China at 31st January, the last day of January.</p>
    <p>I'm adding MathJax: <a href="formula/index.html">Some fancy formulas</a>.</p>
    <p>Yesterday I was happy, pure happy. I taught my mother to use duolingo to learn English. I was really happy. Just like a year ago I was playing with my friend in hometown. How long haven't I had this feeling?</p>
    <p>Speaking of my hometown, I have a lot of memories there. In the winter holiday when I was in Grade Seven, I went to my hometown. Luckily, I met some children playing on the road. They were younger than me. I don't know why but just asked them if I can play with them. From then on, I made many best friends. I still remember their names, though I haven't seen some of them for a long time. Every winter holiday, I go to my hometown for the new year, then I can meet them. We did a lot of fun things.</p>
    <p>I haven't seen then for one year. I miss them so much. But I will see them soon QwQ</p>
    <p>I made a <a href="calculator/index.html">Calculator</a>. It cannot use though.</p>

    <p>Today I go home early, because I want to get a good rest for the upcoming final exam.</p>
    <p>At school, I actually did not do a lot of things. The teacher let us to attend the USACO contest. I am a noob, so I only did the first question. I know it's the problem was not difficult, they were only the Bronze division. Maybe it's a wrong choice for me to attend OI.</p>
    <p>I found there were some students doing homework in our classroom. I wish they will get good grades in the exam.</p>
    <p>Well now I'm at home. I am confused because I don't want to do anything, even programming. Am I too tired?</p>
    <p>I want to learn Calculus. AwA</p>

    <p>Today, I tried to read the book <em>Calculus, Early Transcendentals, Ninth Edition, Metric Version</em>. Well, I like the book. It was bought by my father, who bought plenty of books for me. I used almost 3 hours to read the book this morning, but I only finished chapter 1.1. There are too many exercises, which I must spend may time on that.</p>
    <p>I hate to go to extra-curricular class. My father signed up a Chinese extra-curricular class for me. I really, really, really don't want to go there.</p>
    <p>I'm learning how to make <a href="weather/index.html">weather icons</a>.</p>

    <p>I updated the clock, now it looks much much better! I use <em>Sunaōkami Shiroko</em> in the game <em>Blue Archive</em> as the background.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow will be the final exam, I prepare display my block on the screen lol.</p>
    <p>By the way, I'm not nervous at all.</p>

    <p>Just now, I walked home with cxy. She's a really friendly girl.</p>
    <p>Today's exam was over, I think everything was ok. I don't have any feeling. Maybe that is my advantage.</p>
    <p>I upgrate the <a href="clock/index.html">clock</a>. Now it has random background picture.</p>
    <p>I rewrite the clock, means I write the clock all again by myself! I'm proud of it and I feel happy.</p>

    <p>I feel werid. I'm not sleepy but only tired, like something is forcing me to stay awake. I can't sleep this noon, though I'm very sleepy. Someone told me this is normal.</p>
    <p>Well, there's nothing need to be write down. See u tomorrow!</p>

    <p>The teacher gave us 16 papers for the holiday, I hope I will have time to finish it.</p>
    <p>I miss my friends in my hometown so much. Yesterday, one of them told me that she had bought a new year gift for me. She was so nice. I'm really excited. I wish I could see them quickily.</p>
    <p>This evening, we choose some award winners, including <em>expressive person</em>, <em>person who has a lot of charisma</em> and so on. Actually I hope my classmates vote in a fair way, which means they should consider all the students but not vote for one person without thinking if he/she can deserve that or not.</p>
    <p>I'm wondering if any of my classmates can play chess. I asked three classmates and got the answer no. I started learning chess a week ago and I fall in love with it now.</p>
    <p>Also, I'm learning piano. I saw the video hcx uploaded to Wechat Moment. In the video, she played the piano and guitar and looked really handsome. She's brillant!</p>
    <p>I'm too tired today. Tomorrow, I'm going to add a footer so that one can find pages they want more easily.</p>
    <p>By the way, I think I did well in the final exam.</p>

    <p>There are only four days left until the winter holiday. I will see Ruirui and Chengcheng soon! I have to value the time I spend with them, as I can only see them about a week per year(or even 0 days when my parents decided to spend the year in Sichuan).</p>
    <p>Today, I teach gzx how to play chess. He learnt well.</p>
    <p>One of my best friend today was having a bit of an emotional breakdown. He/She cried almost the afternoon because of poor grades and wanted to go home. He/She said he/she didn't want to stay at school anymore, but he/she didn't want his/her father to make a trip. I don't know how to comfort him/her.</p>
    <p>I finished the footer, you can see it below.</p>
    <p>cbp want me to attend HTOI with him, but I have to have classes. He's lucky. He can spend all afternoon learning OI.</p>
    <p>I heard that tomorrow we will attend a lecture.</p>

    <p>This is LikablePie79015 from Henan, China at 7th February, 12:09.</p>
    <p>I forgot to update yesterday. Yesterday, we went to the laboratory and did chemical experiments. It really cost time. I only did 2 of the experiments. And one of our test tube has something dirty on it which I brush for a long time but couldn't clean it.</p>
    <p>All the scores are out. zzx got 125 in Chinese so that she needn't do Chinese homework. Congratulations to her! The homeroom teacher asked me to pay more attention on chemistry, biology and Chinese, because I only got 75, 65 and 95. He also told me to ask my deskmate how to learn chemistry well. Actually I have no idea why my chemistry score is a little bit low. But I know the reason why my biology score is low is that I didn't memorizing texts.</p>
    <p>Yesterday afternoon, we had lectures on career discovery. I was assigned to a job about bank. Well the job didn't match me.</p>
    <p>I didn't expect there to be some like me who knows Lambda Calculus. And beacuse of him, I'm now interested in making John Tromp Diagrams in C++. </p>
    <p>We change our classroom where we learn OI. Now it is at floor 2, which means I needn't have to walk upstair for a long time, but as a result, I can not pass our classroom.</p>
    <p>OI is really hard.</p>

    <p>When I was tidying my stuff, I found my <a href="GrowthMemories/index.html"><em>Growth Memories</em></a> that my junior high school gave me when I was Grade Eight. At that age, I was interested in writing a diary and noted down a plenty of interesting memories. I think I now understand the meaning of keeping a diary.</p>

    <p>Today's test is really difficult. 3 purple and 1 black. xhx is so powerful. He's only Grade Eight but is much better than me. I admire him so much.</p>
    <p>I'm going to write a page for birthday wishes.</p>
