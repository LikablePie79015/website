    <p>My First Website!!! That's really GREAT!!!</p>
    <p>But this is only a static website, you cannot interact with it :(.</p>
    <p>Today is a good day. I'm learning how to make a website. I'm happy.</p>
    <p>I'm sad, since I will say goodbye to some of my classmates soon. They will go to new classes whose teacher will only teach the subjects they choose. I think... that's a great thing I mean. They can learn their favourite good at subjects. I think we can meet each other anyway.</p>
    <p>I'm sleepy. My final exam is coming, but I'm not nervous. I don't care how mmany points I get. I just want to keep company with my classmates, my <em>friends</em>. I'm happy everyone when I see my classmates. I don't know why, when I see my classmates, I can't help smiling. A big smile, a smile in heart. It's like... well I can't describe it. Really strange but good feeling.</p>
    <p>It's not early now. I must go to bed, or I will be sleepy tomorrow on class.</p>

    <p>Today is the last workday before the final exam. I took the archives all back and gave back to my classmates. They will save their archives by themselves. After the winter break, they will give the archives to school again. Maybe they will give me. I hope they will give me.</p>
    <p>I think these days I'm a little... tired? Sometimes I don't have interests in maths, physics, or even programming. It's like I don't want to do anything, just want to lie down and rest. Is this feeling normal?</p>

    <div class="learn1">
      <p>I have learnt how to use a flex box.</p>
      <p>It can align the elements in one line! Fun!</p>
    </div>

    <p>And I'm trying to make a fun thing. <a href="todo/index.html">Click to have a look</a></p>
    <p>Although I write it by following the tutorial, I still feel proud of it. Next time I will make sth by myself.</p>
    <p>Also, I made a simple clock! <a href="clock/index.html">Have a look!</a></p>
    <p>This clock is too easy lol.</p>
    <p>Well let's talk about today's life. You know I hardly ever do my homework due to less time. But this morning, I knew I had to write some homework or my teacher will ponish me. Thus, I do some of my chemistry homework, 6 of 16 pages. However, on chemistry class, our teacher found that I didn't finished the homework while I was sharing my homework to my deskmate whose homework was lost. The teacher asked angrily to us: "Who didn't write". That moment, I was panick, really panick. The teacher let me off when she saw the 6 of 16 homework. But my heart beat quickily. I have never had this feeling for a long time. I was scared... Even hours later, I can not still calm down...</p>
    <p>I hope I won't have such feelings anymore, it's miserable.</p>
